Downsampler
===========

This repo contains the files for the Eurorack modular Downsampler created in the WS 17/18 Projekt Labor Course at TU Berlin.
The Eagle file was updated to be more readable. The LTSpice files are now up to date with the latest schematics.
Both the Eagle and LTSpice files contain the latest version from the end of the course.
